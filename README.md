# KnightHacks Workshop Slides
This repository contains the slides and code for all of our workshops. Each
workshop has a folder. Inside the folder, you should find the slides in pdf
format, code (usually as a git submodule), and possibly one or two other things.

# Getting the Code
It is recommended to simply click through on GitHub to the workshop repository
you want, and then run
```
git clone <repository_url>
```
in a terminal.

If, for some reason, you want to clone this repository, you will need to use the
command
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/KnightHacks/workshop-slides.git
```
This will recursively clone all of the code for every workshop.
